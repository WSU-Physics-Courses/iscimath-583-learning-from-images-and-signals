	title = {Atom Interferometric Imaging of Differential Potentials Using an Atom Laser},
	year = {2022},
	abstract = {Interferometry is a prime technique for modern precision measurements. Atoms, unlike light, have significant interactions with electric, magnetic, and gravitational fields, making their use in interferometric applications particularly versatile. Here, we demonstrate atom interferometry to image optical and magnetic potential landscapes over an area exceeding $240 \mu m \times 600 \mu m$. The differential potentials employed in our experiments generate phase imprints in an atom laser that are made visible through a Ramsey pulse sequence. We further demonstrate how advanced pulse sequences can enhance desired imaging features, e.g. to image steep potential gradients. A theoretical discussion is presented that provides a semiclassical analysis and matching numerics.}}
